-- Considerations -- 

Without modifiers that are specific to each entity, it's pretty easy because we can prompt the AI to create 
a few emails then send them out in bulk mail batches to recipients. This is easy and quick; however, with 
OSINT modifiers each email recipient would need a prompt for each specific email. A couple solutions come to mind.
 
1) We prompt the AI to give us prompts with placeholders ([First Name] [Last name]), then we handle the 
placeholder replacement text on our side with the modifiers. This keeps the queries minimal, but requires 
us to develop the placeholder replacement.
 
2) We segment out who will be receiving modified emails. We could do this for C-Suite, etc.. This would 
require only a handful of queries for the a select number, while the rest of recipients receive general 
non specific emails from a few general queries. 
 
3) We do custom AI queries for every recipient.. I find this problematic. if the org is only 10-30, not 
terrible. But if the org is 100 plus, this is perhaps a lot of queries and more time intensive. The viability 
of this would likely depend on what our query limit would be from the provider. I don't love this idea, but it 
takes all of the work off our plate of doing placeholder replacements and how to handle placeholder replacement 
when some recipients might have 5 modifiers [name, college, gym membership, etc] and others only have 1 [name].
